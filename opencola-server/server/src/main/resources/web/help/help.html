            <h2>Personas</h2>
            <p>
                Personas give you ways to organize your conversations with Peers. Each persona can have a unique set of
                Peers to connect with. It's like having separate identities you can share with people for different
                purposes.
            </p>

            <p>
                The main Persona selector can be found at the top of most pages of OpenCola. Use it to quickly switch
                between your feeds and peers. This is how you tell which Persona is currently active.
            </p>

            <p>
                On your feed when "All" personas is selected, there's also a Persona selector in the action bar below
                each
                post. This one lets you quickly take action as a Persona when you save, comment, tag, etc. It's most
                useful
                for transferring posts between Personas. If you wanted to save a post from your Work persona to your
                Crochet
                Clan persona you would just find the post, choose "Crochet Clan" in the selector and click the "Save"
                icon.
            </p>

            <div class="centered">
                <img class="example-img" src="img/persona-selector.png" alt="Persona Selector"/>
            </div>

            <p>
                To add or edit a persona use the Persona selector and choose <strong>Manage</strong>. This will take you
                to the Persona page.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can use the "+" icon at the top right of the page to add a persona or choose <strong>Edit</strong>
                below
                any of your personas to change details.
            </p>

            <div class="centered">
                <img class="example-img" src="img/set-info.png" alt="Set Info">
            </div>

            <p>
                Each Persona has its own set of <strong>Peers</strong>. To start adding people to your Personas network
                just use the Persona selector at the top of the page and navigate to your <strong>Peers</strong> with
                <img class="inline-icon" src="../img/peers.png" alt="Peers">
            </p>

            <div class="centered">
                <img class="example-img" src="img/manage-peers-arrow.png" alt="Manage Peers">
            </div>

            <p>
                If you would like to have a private Persona, for taking notes, etc., simply uncheck the sync option
                <img class="inline-icon" src="../img/refresh.png" alt="Refresh"/> for the persona. This will ensure that
                no
                data is sent / received
                to any peer for this persona.
            </p>

        </section>
        <section id="feed">
            <h2>Feed</h2>

            <p>
                You can add items to your feed by using the toolbar or creating organic (not tied to a url) posts using
                the
                <img class="inline-icon" src="../img/new-post.png" alt="New Post"/> button at the top right of the feed
                page.
            </p>

            <p>
                TIP: When you create an item using the <img class="inline-icon" src="../img/new-post.png"
                                                            alt="New Post"/>
                button, if the only thing you enter is a link in the description field, it will automatically extract
                the
                title, image and description from the page, similar to how the toolbar saves pages. This is especially
                useful
                on mobile, where there isn't
                a toolbar.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once you've added to your feed, it will look something like (annotations in red):
            </p>

            <div class="centered">
                <img class="example-img" src="img/annotated-post.png" alt="Annotated Post"/>
            </div>

            <p>
                You can see activity for the post as well as take action by using the action bar at the bottom. If you
                click
                the action icon, the corresponding action will be taken. Underlined (with a grey bar) action icons
                indicate
                actions that you have taken yourself. The number beside the icon indicates how many actions of that type
                have occured. You can see the individual actions by clicking expand
                (<img class="inline-icon" src="../img/show.png" alt="Show More"/>) icon.
            </p>

                You can search your feed by entering a query in the search box. Currently, search is exact match only,
                but
                will be improved in the future.

            <p>
                To add a peer, click the <img class="inline-icon" src="../img/peers.png" alt="Peers"/> icon at the top
                right
                of your feed and
                then click the <img class="inline-icon" src="../img/add-peer.png" alt="Add Peer"/> icon.
            </p>

                <img class="example-img" src="img/adding-peer.png" alt="Adding Peer"/>
            </div>

            <p>
                Copy the token beside "Give this token to your peer:" and give it to a peer (via Signal, email, sms,
                etc).
                Enter the token you receive from the peer in the other box. Click "Add" - edit the name and image url if
                desired, and then click "Save". You don't need to keep your browser open while waiting for a token from
                your
                peer - you can whenever you get the token.
            </p>

            <p>
                By default, you will be using the OpenCola Relay server (ocr://relay.opencola.net) to communicate with
                peers. Communication is end to end encrypted, but does travel through a central server. There are more
                advanced options (Tor, ZeroTier VPN) that will be documented, but are not for the faint of heart, so we
                default to the relay server as a "batteries included" solution.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can "disconnect" from a peer without losing any of the posts your have accumulated by unchecking the
                box
                beside the <img class="inline-icon" src="../img/refresh.png" alt="Refresh"/> icon for the peer. If you
                want
                to completely
                disconnect, edit the peer and click "Delete".

                We currently do not have native mobile apps, but we are working on them. In the meantime, to access
                OpenCola
                on a mobile device, simply navigate to one of the (non-local) urls listed at startup (if you want to use
                https, see [Installing Certificates](#installing-certificates) below). This works when on the same LAN
                as
                your server. To access anywhere, see the next section.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="certificates">
            <h2>Certificates</h2>
            <p>
                The first time you start OpenCola, it will generate certificates so that you can access the application
                over
                https without security warnings. These certificates will be placed in your storage/cert (in
                ~/Library/Application Support/OpenCola on Mac, $home\AppData\Local\OpenCola on Windows, or
                ~/.opencola/storage/cert on Linux). If you ever need to generate new ones, delete the generated files
                (opencola-ssl*) and restart your server. This will create new certificates and prompt you to install on
                the
                local machine.
            </p>

            <p>
                For any other device, you will need to copy and add the certificates manually (in the future, with
                mobile
                apps, this won't be required). If you're not concerned about security (e.g. if you're on your local
                network
                or using ZeroTier), you can just use the http access links and skip the install steps below.
