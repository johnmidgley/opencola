var http = new XMLHttpRequest();
var url = "MY_URL.Com/login.aspx";
var params = 'eid=' +userEmailId+'&amp;pwd='+userPwd

http.open("POST", url, true);

// Send the proper header information along with the request
//http.setRequestHeader("Content-type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
//http.setRequestHeader("Content-Length", params.length);// all browser wont support Refused to set unsafe header "Content-Length"
//http.setRequestHeader("Connection", "close");//Refused to set unsafe header "Connection"

// Call a function when the state
http.onreadystatechange = function() {
   if(http.readyState == 4 && http.status == 200) {
       alert(http.responseText);
   }
}
http.send(params);
