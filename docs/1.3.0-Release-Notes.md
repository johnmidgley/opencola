This release brings some important features and imrpovements as well as a number of minor bug fixes.


## File attachments

You can now added arbitrary file attachments to posts, allowing you to share pdf documents, images and more.

## Cleaned up UI

* Image treatment is now more promininet, giving your feed a more traditional feed look. 
* Creating / editing posts has been simplified
* Comments are now done in a markdown wysiwyg editor.  

## Standardized Serialization 

The original storage serialization formats were custom for maximum size efficiency. These formats have now been moved to protobuf, improving future interoperability and extendability.

> NOTE: Since the transaction data format has changed, your transaction chain needs to be re-generated and re-signed. When you start OpenCola, your data will be automatically migrated. You will temporarily lose access to your peer data, because it is incompatible with the new format. Once your peers upgrade, their data will automatically re-synchronize. 

## Re-write of Relay Server Protocol

The new relay server protocol use protobuf messages, includes a number of efficiency improvements, and now supports store and forward functionality, so that you can receive peer updates even when they are not online
